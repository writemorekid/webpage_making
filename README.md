# ðŸŽ² Dice Roll GUI Application

This is a simple **Python GUI application** that simulates the rolling of a dice. It uses the **Tkinter** library for the graphical interface and **PIL (Pillow)** for image handling. The app shows a rolling animation, displays a random dice face, and includes a fun bounce effect on the window.

## ðŸ§° Features

- GUI-based dice rolling using `tkinter`
- Dice face images displayed using `Pillow`
- Rolling animation with a delay
- Bouncing window effect for fun interaction
- Background color customization

## ðŸ“¸ Preview

> *Make sure to place 6 dice images named as `dice-1.png`, `dice-2.png`, ..., `dice-6.png` in the same folder.*

Example dice images must be 100x100 pixels or scaled appropriately.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository or download the script:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dice-roll-gui.git
   cd dice-roll-gui
   ```

2. **Make sure you have Python and required packages installed:**

   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```

3. **Place the dice face images (dice-1.png to dice-6.png) in the same folder.**

4. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python dice_roll_gui.py
   ```

## ðŸ–¼ Dice Images

You must provide the following images in the same directory:
- `dice-1.png`
- `dice-2.png`
- `dice-3.png`
- `dice-4.png`
- `dice-5.png`
- `dice-6.png`

Ensure the images are properly named and formatted (square aspect ratio is ideal).
